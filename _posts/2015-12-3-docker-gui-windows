There's been several posts about running Linux GUI apps on a Mac using Docker. I thought I'd try doing it on Windows. This is so I can remember what I did.

What I had installed:
Windows 8.1
[Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox) - You'll need this to run Docker, obvs
[Cygwin/X](http://x.cygwin.com/) - Cygwin doesn't come with an X server by default, so you'll need the Cygwin/X version. This let's you run an X11 server on your machine.

I'm actually relatively new to setting up and running X servers, so feel free to offer any comments/suggestions for improvement.

Start up the Cygwin terminal.
export DISPLAY=your-machine-ip:0.0
startxwin -- -listen tcp &
xhost + your-machine-ip
eval "$(docker-machine env your-machine-name)"
docker run --rm -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix firefox
