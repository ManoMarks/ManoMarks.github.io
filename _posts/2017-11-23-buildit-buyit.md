Build It or Buy It
There's a constant tension between developers and developer tools providers. Developers want to use services and infrastructure, and service providers want to lock you into their platforms. Lock-in isn't always a bad thing, as long as you continue to get the service. But sometimes, like the Facebook Parse shutdown earlier this year, services go away. My talk will explore that tension, what motivates developer tools companies, and what motivates developers. And I'll discuss strategies to evaluate new developer tools, and mitigate the impact of lock-in.
